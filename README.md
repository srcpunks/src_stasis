# src_stasis

**Data management app for the decentralized and censorship-resistant Swarm network**

---

### Overview

`src_stasis` is a cross-platform desktop/Android app enabling users to manage data on the **Swarm** decentralized network.

---

### Features (Planned)

- **Data upload**: Upload files & directories to the Swarm
- **Data retrieval**: Download data from Swarm
- **Website upload**: Deploy static websites from local drives and Git repositories
- **Built-in bee**: Run a node in light or ultra-light mode to access the Swarm
- **Remote bee**: Connect to a remote bee node rather than running one
- **Stamps management**: Ability to buy, top up, and dilute postage batches
- **Private data**: Encrypt or decrypt data when uploading or downloading from Swarm

---

### Ethos

These foundational values drive the project's development:

- **Source-Only Installation**: No centralized app stores or 3rd-party built binaries. Install through package managers that build from source (ex: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/), [Obtainium](https://obtainium.imranr.dev/))
- **Decentralized by Design**: No cloud dependencies, full user control over data and infrastructure
- **Encryption by default**: Data is protected using Swarm's native encryption facility before uploading
